# OBSI - CLI helpers for markdown-based knowledge base
This is my dockerized CLI app called `obsi` 
automating tasks related to my markdown-based [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) notes.

# Features
- tag index generation: creating pages that list all usages of a specific tag
- ml-based tag recommendations (based on other tags)

## Upcoming Features
- generation of calendar
- suggest tags (content-based, link-based)
- find missing tags (e.g. by folder structure)
- spaced repetition
- list tags
- define rules to enforce
- formatting?
